# System Programming and Process Management

Project for Operating System class at Texas Tech University, with professor Dr. Yong Chen.

The `Makefile` contains the configuration to compile the C programs. 

The source codes `hello_child.c` and `hello_child2.c` contain the different types of child process creation required for the exercise. 
* `hello_child.c` is for the requirements 1-4
* `hello_child2.c` is for requirement 5

The `script.sh` file contain the UNIX commands necessary to compile the source code, passing along the inputs 2, 4, and 8 as requested.

To run the programs: `./script.sh`
